##  Key Insights

The analyses provide several key insights;
- *High Concentration in Research and Development Department:* The Research and Development department holds majority of the workforce (961 employees), followed by Sales department.
- *Attrition Concentrated in Young & Mid-Level Employees:* The 26–35 age group represents nearly half of the total attrition (116 out of 237) which shows retention challenges in early to mid-  career employees.
- *Gender Diversity Gap:* Males constitute 60% of the workforce.
- *Job Satisfaction Concern:* Approximately 39% of employees rated their job satisfaction as ‘Very Dissatisfied’ or ‘Dissatisfied’.
- *Overtime has Minimal Impact on Earnings:* The average difference in salary between employees who do overtime and those who don’t is marginal ($70).

##  Recommendations

Based on the results above, organizations are hereby recommended to;
- *Monitor Overtime Utilization:* Since overtime does not significantly boost earnings, reassess overtime policies to ensure employee well-being.
- *Enhance Work-Life Balance Initiatives:* With a significant number of employees dissatisfied with work-life balance, flexible work arrangements or wellness programs could be introduced.
- *Implement Retention Programs for Young Employees:* Implement targeted engagement and career progression plans for employees aged 26–35 to reduce attrition. 
- *Review Compensation Structures:* Evaluate the competitiveness of salary bands especially for employees earning below $5k to ensure market alignment.
- *Develop Gender Diversity Initiatives:* Develop policies and recruitment strategies to bridge the gender gap especially in technical and leadership roles.
- *Revamp Job Satisfaction Strategies:* Conduct surveys to identify dissatisfaction causes and introduce improvement plans focusing on work environment, recognition and career development.
